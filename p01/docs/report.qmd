Frequent k-mers in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome
Israel Gonzalez and Gabriel Romero

For this project our first two tasks where to implement two algorithms to find Frequent
k-mers in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome.  For these algorithms we were using a string text of
ACGTTTCACGTTTTACGG with a kmer length of 3.  The first algorithm was based on the PatternCount method.
First we began with pseudocode for the pattern count method:
PatternCount(Text, Pattern)
    count <- 0
    for i <- 0 to |text| - |pattern|
        if text(i, |pattern|) = pattern
            count <- count + 1
        return count

When putting this method into python we simply set the count to 0, and used a for loop
to subtract the 3mer patterns from the entire string length of the genome.

Straightforwardly to find the most frequent kmers in a string text, we generated an array
called frequent_words that held the genome sequence. Next in the method we generated a 
count array that stores the count and pattern of the 3-mers.
|Text| - k + 1
