# Abstract
In this project, we assemble input DNA k-mers to an output sequence, such that the assembled sequence has the same k-composition with the true unknown sequence. Also, it implements the de Bruijn graph to represent k-mers and then find a Eulerian path from the graph. For this, the project implements a hash function to match the prefix and suffix of a k-mer to those of other k-mers, implement de Bruijn graph construction to represent k-mers by a directed graph, and implement a Eulerian cycle finding algorithm to find a cycle on a directed graph.

# Introduction
Assembling genomes is a critical task in bioinformatics, as it allows researchers to study the genetic material of various organisms, including humans, animals, and plants. High-throughput sequencing technologies such as Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences generate massive amounts of short reads that need to be assembled into longer contiguous sequences (contigs). The de Bruijn graph approach is a widely used method for genome assembly that is based on constructing a graph where the nodes correspond to k-mers (substrings of length k) present in the reads, and the edges represent the overlaps between the k-mers. By traversing the graph using Eulerian cycles or paths, we can reconstruct the original sequence of the genome.

The advantage of using the de Bruijn graph approach is that it can handle large amounts of data efficiently and accurately, even for genomes with repetitive regions that are difficult to assemble using other methods. The approach also allows for the detection of genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variations (SVs), by comparing the assembled genome to a reference genome or other assembled genomes.

Overall, the de Bruijn graph approach, coupled with the use of Eulerian cycles or paths, has revolutionized the field of genome assembly and has enabled researchers to study the genetics of a wide range of organisms with unprecedented accuracy and speed.

# Methods

We proceed in this section to describe the methods we have implemented in Python to emulate the skeleton code provided by Dr. Song, and the way they can be used in an executable Python file `main.py`

## Data structures and algorithms

This is the main file that calls the execution of tests.

```

We have stated in this block the tests because they are a translation of what we had in the C++ skeleton for this project. We have added a function to plot a chart where we show the run time comparison between methods, and also its detail in tables.

```python

from pyllist import dllist

class Node:
  
  def __init__(self, label: str):
    self.m_label = label
    self.m_outgoing = dllist()
    self.m_num_of_incoming = 0

  def print(self):
    print("  ",self.m_label)
    print("   incoming: ",str(self.m_num_of_incoming))
    print("     edges: ",self.m_outgoing)
    
class DiGraph:

  def __init__(self):
    self.m_nodes = []

  def print(self):
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print(" DiGraph ", len(self.m_nodes), " nodes")
    for node in self.m_nodes:
      node.print()
    print("---------------------------------------")

  def textRepresentation(self, hide_labels = True):
    answer = ""
    for i in range(0, len(self.m_nodes)):
      node = self.m_nodes[i]
      if hide_labels:
        answer += str(i) + ' -> '
      else:
        answer += str(i) + '(' + node.m_label + ')' + ' -> '
      elems = list(node.m_outgoing)
      edges = []
      for elem in elems:
        if elem is not None:
          edges.append(str(elem))
      answer += ','.join(edges)
      answer += '\n'
    return answer

```

As task 2 in this project requires, these classes, DiGraph and Node together, implement de Bruijn graph construction to represent k-mers by a directed graph. In our case, we decided to use a double linked list (dllist) to represent the secuence of edges from a node. Also, we have added auxiliary methods to print the information or to represent the graph in its classi text representation.

```python

from typing import List
from pyllist import dllist
from DiGraph import DiGraph, Node

def create_deBruijn_graph_by_string_comp(kmers: List[str], g: DiGraph):
  
  nodes = dllist()

  for kmer in kmers:
    k = len(kmer)

    prefix = kmer[0:k-1]

    itr = nodes.first
    i = 0
    while itr is not None:
      if itr.value.m_label == prefix:
        break
      itr = itr.next
      i += 1

    if itr is None:
      from_node = Node(prefix)
      from_node.m_num_of_incoming = 0
      nodes.append(from_node)
      itr = nodes.last

    from_itr = itr

    suffix = kmer[1:k]

    itr = nodes.first
    j = 0
    while itr is not None:
      if itr.value.m_label == suffix:
        break
      itr = itr.next
      j += 1

    if itr is None:
      to_node = Node(suffix)
      to_node.m_num_of_incoming = 0

      nodes.append(to_node)

      itr = nodes.last

    to_itr = itr

    from_itr.value.m_outgoing.append(j)
    to_itr.value.m_num_of_incoming += 1

  g.m_nodes = [node for node in nodes]
  return g

```
This is the translation we have produced in Python for the explicit function to create the de Brujin graph by k-mer string pairwise comparison.

```python

      val = val << 2
      c = seq[i].lower()
      if c == 'a':
        val += 0
      elif c == 'c':
        val += 1
      elif c == 'g':
        val += 2
      elif c == 't':
        val += 3
      else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid base at position {i}: {seq[i]}")
    return val

    return ht

    # for each k-mer
    for kmer in kmers:
        kmer_len = len(kmer)

        else:

            from_node = Node(prefix)
            g.m_nodes.append(from_node)
            node_id[prefix_id] = len(g.m_nodes) - 1
            from_id = node_id[prefix_id]

        if suffix_id in node_id:
            to_id = node_id[suffix_id]
        else:

            to_id = node_id[suffix_id]
            # insert the new node into the hash table
            seq_hash.insert(suffix_id, to_id)

        # update node to_id's label to suffix if necessary
        if g.m_nodes[to_id].m_label != suffix:
            g.m_nodes[to_id].m_label = suffix

        # create a new edge (from_id, to_id) by inserting node to_id into the adjaceny list of node from_id
        g.m_nodes[from_id].m_outgoing.appendright(to_id)

        # update the number of incoming edges of node to_id
        g.m_nodes[to_id].m_num_of_incoming += 1
    
    # end for loop
    return g
```

Here, we state the function we have programmed to generate a random sequence DNA. Also, we have programmed the create_deBruijn_graph_by_hashing that basically receiving the graph and the list of kmers using appropiate the keys, produces hashes (generating the hash the prefix and suffix strings to get unique integer ids) so that the execution of the creation of the de Brujin graph is in linear time.

```python

        node = line.strip('\n')
        node = node.replace(' -> ', ' ')
        node = node.split(' ')
        adj_list.setdefault(node[0], [])
        for number in node[1].split(','):
            adj_list[node[0]].append(number)
            circuit_max += 1
    
    return adj_list, circuit_max

After testing many strategies spending many days of effort, this is our last implementation of a class that produces an Eulerian Cycle based on an adjacency list that has relive success in creating correctly the Eulerian Cyles. This is something that crealy the project needs to improve because the majority of times the cycle produced is correct but there are times when is not.

```

Here, there are the functions to detect the presence of a Eulerian cycle, detect what is the Elerian Cycle, and based on our representation of the de Brujing directed graph, produces a Eulerian path. Here, we had a bug. So that, the vast majority of the cases the path produced is incorrect. This influences to fail passing some tests. This function reuires polishing yet.

    with open(file, 'w') as ofs:

        nodes = g.m_nodes
        for node in nodes:
            for to in node.m_outgoing:

```

Here we have programmed in Python the functions the skeleton offers to finally build the sequence and assemble kmers. Also, the function to generate the deBrujin.dot persistence file.

```python

import random

def random_DNA_sequence(min_length=10, max_length=100):#min_length=10, max_length=10000
  length = random.randint(min_length, max_length)
  DNA = ''.join(random.choice('atgc') for _ in range(length))
  return DNA

def get_kmers(seq, k, randomized=True):
  kmers = [seq[i:i+k] for i in range(len(seq) - k + 1)]
  if randomized:
    randomized_kmers = list(kmers)
    nkmers = len(kmers)
    for i in range(nkmers - 1):
      j = random.randint(i, nkmers - 1)
      randomized_kmers[i], randomized_kmers[j] = randomized_kmers[j], randomized_kmers[i]
    return randomized_kmers
  else:
    return kmers

def compare_composition(s1: str, s2: str, k: int) -> bool:
  same_composition = True
  
  if len(s1) != len(s2):
    same_composition = False
  elif s1 == s2:
    same_composition = True
  else:
    composition1 = get_kmers(s1, k)
    composition1.sort()
    composition2 = get_kmers(s2, k)
    composition2.sort()
    same_composition = composition1 == composition2
      
  return same_composition

```

Finally, we state in our project the functions to generate the random DNA sequence, get kmers given a sequence and a length for k, and the function that inspects if two kmers have the same composition.

## How to compile and run project's code

### Python

To run the `main.py` program correctly. the following are the steps are required

* Unzip this project on a path where Python 3.8 or superior is active
* Open a console and go to where the unzipped folder is. Make sure you are in the same level where the `main.py` program is. You can be sure of this printing the directory content with `ls` command
* Run the program with the command `py main.py`
* The program will produce a similar output we have in this report, and also plots, and tables the following sections has in its analysis.

## The k-assembler run time as a function of the number of k-mers

### Results for k-assembler by k-mer pairwise comparison

![Figure 1: Run time of kmer hassembler by pairwise comparison](images/k-mer-pairwise-comparison.png){#q_25}

In this chart, we clearly see that the run time is considerable when we use this method to assemble. The evolution has a quadratic pattern.

|Language|Method|K-length|Run time (secs)|
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 3 | 1.104
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 5 | 20.301
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 7 | 460.319
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 9 | 239.191
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 11 | 783.015
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 13 | 1856.577
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 15 | 1890.373
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 17 | 800.143
|Python| k-mer pairwise comparison | 19 | 5314.455

In this table we can see the exact values for run time each execution had in Python for the method **k-mer pairwise comparison**. For instance, with 3-mers, we obtain 1.104 seconds; with 9-mers, we obtain 239.191 seconds; for 15-mers, we obtain 1890.373 seconds; interestingly, wit the combination of 17-mers, we obtain much less, 800.143 seconds, just to mention some examples this table shows.

### Results for k-assembler by k-mer hashing

![Figure 2: Run time of kmer assembler by hashing](images/k-mer-hashing.png){#q_50}

In this chart, we clearly see that the run time is much less when we use this method to assemble. The evolution has a linear pattern (orange line). Also, to compare the proportions, we have put also the previous method so that we can appreciate the efficiency this algorithm brings.

|Language|Method|K-length|Run time (secs)|
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
|Python| k-mer hashing | 3 | 1.331
|Python| k-mer hashing | 5 | 1.916
|Python| k-mer hashing | 7 | 11.255
|Python| k-mer hashing | 9 | 19.736
|Python| k-mer hashing | 11 | 32.019
|Python| k-mer hashing | 13 | 29.811
|Python| k-mer hashing | 15 | 86.259
|Python| k-mer hashing | 17 | 42.829
|Python| k-mer hashing | 19 | 27.513

In this table we can see the exact values for run time each execution had in Python for the method **k-mer hashing**. For instance, with 3-mers, we obtain 1.3 seconds which is higher than the less-efficiet method (this is correct since for low amount of data to process, a quadratic function in complexity is more efficient than a linear one); with 9-mers, we obtain 19.736 seconds (which represent an improvement in 13 times agains the previous method); for 15-mers, we obtain 86.259 seconds (20 times better); interestingly, wit the combination of 19-mers, we obtain much less, 27.513 seconds (fewer k-mers give faster run time), just to mention some examples this table shows.

# Discussion

This project has been so ilustrative not only because it has challenge our technical ability to translate code from C++ to Python,, but also and more important than this is that it has clarified in a very important way the following conclusions our data supports:

* When using sequence comparison, the run time of k-assembler is proportional to the product of the number of k-mers and the length of the k-mer (complexity is quadratic). This is because the algorithm needs to compare each k-mer with every other k-mer in the dataset.

* When using hashing, the run time of k-assembler is proportional to the number of k-mers (complexity is linear). This is because the algorithm needs to add each k-mer to a hash table, which can be done in constant time per k-mer. Once all k-mers have been added to the hash table, the algorithm needs to check each k-mer to see if it has a corresponding reverse complement in the hash table, which again can be done in constant time per k-mer.

* For both methods, the value of k has a significant impact on the run time of k-assembler. Larger values of k lead to longer k-mers, which in turn lead to fewer k-mers and faster run times. However, larger values of k also increase the likelihood of errors in the assembly due to repeated regions in the genome. Therefore, there is a trade-off between run time and assembly accuracy when choosing the value of k.
